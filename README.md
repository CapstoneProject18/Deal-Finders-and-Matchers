# Deal-Finders-and-Matchers
Deals finders and matchers Creates a map based deal locator. Merchants in a particular area can describe a set of deals that are available. A user can then search for deals within a specific radius, The search can be further optimized by category. Categories are merchant defined and therefore a mechanism of cross-referencing the same categories described using different words becomes necessary. This uses a map based front-end and locates deals within a specific radius.
